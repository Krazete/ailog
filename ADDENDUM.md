# Hiatus Notes

## Post-Live Memos

Following [The Last Live 『hello, world 2022』](https://youtu.be/GTa2HxIsBPM?t=4216), there were two important notes posted by Kasuga Nozomi and Junji Matsuda which both gave insight into the inner workings of Kizuna AI. Nozomi, the voice of Kizuna AI, posted [a note](https://github.com/Krazete/ailog/blob/master/knozomi.md) about her past, her regrets, and her relationship with Kizuna AI. She expresses some guilt about her identity interfering with people's perception of Kizuna AI, but acknowledges the benefits of it. Matsuda, the originator of Kizuna AI, posted [a note](https://github.com/Krazete/ailog/blob/master/jmatsuda.md) about the inspiration, creation, and philosophy of Kizuna AI. He mentions that unlike modern VTubers who are simply people with avatars, Kizuna AI is a virtual being who he envisioned as existing beyond the actor.

I have added copies of these posts to this project primarily due to their intrinsic importance, but also for juxtapositon. Matsuda's note, with his desire of having VTubers perceived separately from their actor, would probably be viewed negatively in light of the replacement conspiracy. Yet Nozomi's note shares the same view, wanting people to see Kizuna AI separately from herself.

I still believe Love-chan and AI-pii were added to the team mainly to reduce AI-chan's workload and let Nozomi do other things, and while I do concede that a gradual replacement and eventual succession was a possible additional objective for them, I still reject the theory that Nozomi was being forced out outright.

## Pre-Return Interviews

Exactly three years after The Last Live, [Kizuna AI returned](https://youtu.be/j53m3DSqhKo). In the months leading up to this, Kasuga Nozomi participated in two two-part interviews opening up more about her experience with Kizuna AI. More pertinently, she talks about the "split scandal" in both interviews, recalling how she was against the announcement of her role as voice model of Kizuna AI and her appointment as advisor to Kizuna AI Inc. but conceded in order to reassure fans.

  * Part 2: https://www.businessinsider.jp/article/2502-kizuna-ai-interview2/

The interviews cover a much wider range of topics than what's relevant to this repository, such as the voice model audition, thoughts about VTuber culture, Kasuga Nozomi's new VTuber person (Non-chii), and plans for the future.

I haven't included copies of them in this repository since they are exclusive to members, but they are free to read. Business Insider requires a free account and KAI-YOU Premium requires a free trial (though you may still be charged a foreign transaction fee).
